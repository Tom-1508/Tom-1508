# Hi, I’m Tamal 👋

I’m a Python backend engineer focused on building clean, maintainable, and
explainable systems. I enjoy working on backend architecture, workflows,
role-based access control, and open-source style codebases.

Currently preparing for Associate Python Engineer roles with a strong focus on
open-source contribution and real-world backend engineering.

## 🌱 Open Source

I’m actively starting to contribute to well-established open-source projects,
with a focus on Python-based frameworks and backend systems (e.g., Frappe).

My goal is to learn by reading real-world codebases, making small but meaningful
contributions, and collaborating through code reviews.
